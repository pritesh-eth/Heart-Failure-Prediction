# Heart-Failure-Prediction

## Overview
Heart failure prediction involves identifying high-risk individuals using data analysis, medical history, and test results to prevent or delay heart failure with early identification and appropriate treatment/lifestyle changes.
This project aims to predict the risk of heart failure in patients using machine learning algorithms and demographic data. The goal is to identify high-risk individuals as early as possible, so that they can receive appropriate treatment and lifestyle changes to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure.
